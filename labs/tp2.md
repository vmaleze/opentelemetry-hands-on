# Lab 2: Let's add some observability

To monitor our microservices, we will use [opentelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [Signoz](https://signoz.io/).

## Signoz

SigNoz is an open-source Datadog or New Relic alternative. Get APM, logs, traces, metrics, exceptions, & alerts in a single tool.

```sh
## Install Signoz (takes quite some time)
helm install signoz signoz/signoz --namespace observability --create-namespace -f signoz/values.yaml

## Add an ingress to access signoz on http://signoz.k3d.local
kubectl apply -f signoz/ingress.yaml
```

You can check when Signoz is up and running by looking at its pods state with Headlamp. Don't forget to switch to the "observabiliy" namespace to find them!

## OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is a collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.

As we are in kubernetes, we will install the following components:

- [OpenTelemetry operator](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/platforms/kubernetes/operator/) => An implementation of a Kubernetes Operator, that manages collectors and auto-instrumentation of the workload using OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries.
- [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) => Vendor-agnostic way to receive, process and export telemetry data.
- [OpenTelemetry Auto-Instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/platforms/kubernetes/operator/automatic/) => An implementation of auto-instrumentation using the OpenTelemetry Operator.  
  The OpenTelemetry Operator supports injecting and configuring auto-instrumentation libraries for .NET, **Java**, Node.js, Python, and Go services.

### OpenTelemetry operator

```sh
## Create a separate namespace to avoid mixing everything
kubectl create ns opentelemetry-operator-system

## Installing cert manager required by the opentelemetry operator.
## We wait for all pods to be ready to avoid any issues while installing the operator after.
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.18.2/cert-manager.yaml && kubectl wait -n cert-manager --for=condition=Ready pods --all --timeout=300s

## Applying the opentelemetry-operator manifest (1).
kubectl -n opentelemetry-operator-system apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
```

(1). We prefer to use the yaml manifest to always be on the latest version. A [helm chart](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/opentelemetry-operator) exists for the operator, but it is generally not updated fast enough to follow the latest changes.

### OpenTelemetry Collector

- Understanding the collector
  ![Collector](assets/otel-collector.png "otel-collector")

- Create an `observability` directory.
- Create an `otel-collector.yaml` file with:

```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: otel
  namespace: microservices
spec:
  mode: daemonset # Specifies how to deploy the collector, cf https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/blob/main/README.md#deployment-modes
  image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.133.0
  config:
    receivers: # How to receive Open Telemetry data.
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc: {}
          http: {}

    exporters: # Where to export Open Telemetry data.
      otlp/signoz:
        endpoint: signoz-otel-collector.observability:4317
        tls:
          insecure: true

    service: # Configure each pipeline of Open Telemetry data.
      pipelines:
        logs:
          receivers: [otlp]
          exporters: [otlp/signoz]
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          exporters: [otlp/signoz]
        metrics:
          receivers: [otlp]
          exporters: [otlp/signoz]
```

- Install the collector:

```sh
kubectl apply -f observability/otel-collector.yaml
```

### Java agent

- Create an `otel-instrumentation.yaml` file with:

```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: otel-auto-instrumentation
  namespace: opentelemetry-operator-system
spec:
  exporter:
    endpoint: http://otel-collector-headless:4318
  sampler:
    type: parentbased_always_on # see tp4 for more information
  java:
    image: ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/autoinstrumentation-java:2.19.0
```

- Install the instrumentation:

```sh
kubectl apply -f observability/otel-instrumentation.yaml
```

- Restart all deployments to take the instrumentation into account

```sh
kubectl rollout restart deploy order
kubectl rollout restart deploy product
kubectl rollout restart deploy stock
kubectl rollout restart deploy shopping-cart
```

> [!NOTE]  
> All deployments are using a helm chart that already takes into account the injection of the java agent.  
> Feel free to check the helm chart to know how it's done => [here](https://github.com/vmaleze/opentelemetry-hands-on/blob/e492bdfc362b5eb8b4900102f4ac7c147277d7e7/microservices/infra/microservices-base-chart/templates/deployment.yaml#L21)

- Relaunch order simulation

```sh
kubectl delete pod traffic-simulation-pod
kubectl apply -f ./traffic-simulation/traffic-simulation-pod.yaml
```

## Find the bug

- Go to the [signoz dashboard](http://signoz.k3d.local) and try to pinpoint the issue.
